## Introduction 
A contract is the fundamental building block of Eth's applications - all variables belong to a contract
  
All solidity source code should start with a "version pragma" a declaration of the
version of the Solidity compiler this code should use. 
  
This is to prevent issues with future compiler versions potentially introducing changes that would break your code

#### uint
uint is unsigned integers and it is a data type that as to be non-negative 

in Solidity, uint is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsinged integer - you can also declare units with less bits too - uint8, uint16, uint32
